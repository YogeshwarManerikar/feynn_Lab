In the present grain-identification and detection system type of grain and grain quality are identified manually 
by visual inspection which is difficult and not accurate. In this paper we are focusing about the methods used 
for detection of grain. An machine vision system is introduced which is used for grain type identification and 
differentiate different type of grains based on special features (color,geometrical) as attributes for 
classification. The grading of rice sample is done according to the size ,shape and texture of the grain .A good 
classification accuracy is achieved using only 6 features, i.e. mean of RGB colors and 3 geometrical features. 
Also image Pre-processing, Feature extraction, Image Acquisition, Filtering, Morphological operation and 
segmentation are going to be perform to differentiate the grain
